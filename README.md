🎉 Event Management System – Salesforce Capstone Project
📌 Project Overview
Managing events manually often leads to missed registrations, confusion in resource allocation, and difficulty in tracking participants or generating reports.
This project aims to build a Salesforce-based Event Management System that streamlines the entire process of organizing events — from registrations to reporting.

🎯 Problem Statement
Event organizers face challenges in handling registrations, communicating with participants, tracking sponsors, and monitoring resources. Without a centralized system, it becomes difficult to manage event operations effectively.

The objective is to design and implement a Salesforce CRM solution that enables efficient event planning, participant management, and performance tracking through automation and dashboards.

✅ Objectives
Create and manage multiple events (date, venue, type, capacity).
Allow participant registration and track details in Salesforce.
Send automated confirmation emails and reminders for events.
Maintain records of sponsors and resources allocated per event.
Build reports and dashboards for event performance insights.
